 * Desc:
    * Using the same Die class, write a program called RollRace that creates two Die objects, 
    * and keeps rolling them to see which one comes up three sixes in a row first. 
    * Continue rolling the dice until one of them wins the race and consider the possibility 
    * that they might tie. Print the results of each roll, and at the end print the winner and 
    * total number of rolls that were required.
 * 
 * Points: [15 points]
